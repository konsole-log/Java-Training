#CLASS DAY-1(6/24):
-> class name should be same as the file name
-> entry point always start as public static void main(String[] args){}
Access modifier:
    -public:
    -static: this makes method run without creating an object
    -main(): this is the name of method
*==we should use import java.util.Scanner for Scanner class==*
Scanner: used to take input from the user this is the Scanner class
-new: keyword to create new object
syntax: Scanner <scanner_name> = new Scanner(System.in);
=Tasks:
    1. odd and even
    2. 1 to 10 print

#CLASS DAY-2(6/26)
--> about OOP in java 
--> attributes and other stuffs like method and instances
--> making constructor
use of stack and heap memory to save the stuffs for the objects and class
constructor of basically two types used in Java they are:
* default constructor: where we don't pass any argument/parameter and in default cases it is 
given by java compiler.
* parameterised constructor: where we pass argument/parameters and it is user defined
example for the default constructor and parameterised constructor is given below:
class Shape{
    private int dimension;//this is called as attribute 
        Shape(){
            //this is the default constructor
        }
        Shape(int dimension){
            this.dimension=dimension
            //this is parameterised constructor
        }
}
for encapsulation we use getter and setter:
-->getter is
